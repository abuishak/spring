<p>"Survey the Yard
Make note of tree limbs that should be removed or cabled, especially those that overhang structures. Hire an arborist to maintain large trees.Cut down last year's perennial foliage, and toss it into the compost pile. Rake mulch from beds planted with bulbs before foliage appears, and refresh mulch in other planting areas after soil warms. Check fences, steps, and pathways for disrepair caused by freezing and thawing.</p>

<h2>Garden</h2>
<p>The sun is shining, birds are singing and it's time for your garden to come back from the winter weather. Your garden needs some help getting back in shape, though, so it's time to get the supplies from the home improvement store, pull out the tools from the shed and get to work.

Here are some tips for your getting your spring garden green and beautiful by the time the season reaches its peak:

1. Clean out the garden.

It's time to clean your garden and remove all the debris (leaves, leftover snow, etc.) Get rid of weeds, making sure that you get the roots so they won't grow back. This is also a good time to sharpen your garden tools, if needed, because you're going to require them for plant maintenance and soil care.</p>

<p> Plant It Right for Healthier, Long-Lived Plants
May 14, 2015

The future success of any new landscape plantings depends heavily on whether or not you plant them correctly. Improperly planted plants are far less able to cope with adverse conditions such as disease, insect attack, and drought. Trees are much less forgiving than perennials, but proper planting techniques apply generally to all plants.
